# update-kali
A script to set up a new Kali Linux installation with additional tools

# What is this?
I find that I need to keep a lot of kali installations up to date, and I like them to be setup in a similar format. This script installs the tools I'm likely to use, creates directories, etc. Currently it's just set up for my personal use, but I'm intending to make it more generic over time.
